# OverTheWire: Bandit Level 0 Guide

Welcome to my guide for the Bandit Level 0 of the OverTheWire wargames.

## Task

Your task is to gain access to the game server using the following credentials:

- **Server:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- **Port:** `2220`
- **Username:** `bandit0`
- **Password:** `bandit0`

## Solution

To connect to the server, you will use an SSH client. The standard command structure for the SSH command at this level is as follows:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
**password**
```bash
bandit0
```
